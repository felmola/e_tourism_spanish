    <p>You were assigned to the role of seller. Remember that you will keep this role during the 5 trading rounds. You
        will be able to sell only one package per trading round. The computer will randomly assign you one of the 5
        available packages for you to sell in the market. Keep in mind that other sellers may sell the same package as
        you. Additionally, you will be given a "value" of that package. This value represents the cost you would incur
        if you were to close a transaction.</p>

    <p>Keep in mind that the costs are private, that is, only you know this number. Neither the other sellers nor the
        buyers know this information. In total there are 5 types of tourist packages whose only difference will be the
        destination: Berlín, Madrid, Viena, Paris and Roma. You will only receive one of these and its respective
        cost.</p>

    <p>You will have to fix a price for the package that was assigned to you. This price must be higher than the cost
        of the package. Your earnings will be calculated as the difference between the price you set and the cost of the
        package. If you fail to complete a transaction, you will not incur any costs, but you will not make any profit
        either. Think of it this way, let's suppose you have a chance to get the package in question, and if you manage.
        to sell it, you'll earn the difference. The cost is what you would have to pay to get the package. If the cost
        is 50 UME and you manage to sell the package for 70 UME, then your profit would be 20 UME (plus the initial
        endowment of {{ Constants.endowment }} UME). If you do not sell the package, your profit would be zero (plus the initial
        endowment of {{ Constants.endowment }} UME), i.e. you would not incur in any costs and would not receive any income.</p>

    <p>Let's see another example:</p>

    <p>Suppose the cost of your package is 30 UME and you manage to sell the package at a price of 50 UME. You will then
        earn 50 UME - 30 UME = 20 UME (plus the initial endowment of {{ Constants.endowment }} UME). If you fail to
        close a transaction, you will not incur in any no cost nor profit, i.e. your profit will be 0 UME (plus the initial
        endowment of {{ Constants.endowment }} UME)</p>

    <p>It is important to note that two buyers can select the same offer, but only one of them will complete the
        transaction. The one who makes the decision to buy the package the fastest will be the one who completes the
        transaction with you.</p>

    <p>Additionally, you can choose a commercial practice to help make your package more attractive in the market. There
        are three commercial practices and if you use them, they will be visible to the buyer at the time of completing
        the transaction. However, keep in mind that any of these commercial practices can be used truthfully or
        untruthfully.</p>

    {% else %}
    <p>You were assigned to the role of buyer. Remember that you will keep this role during the 5 trading rounds.
        You will be able to buy only one package per trading round. The computer will give you a "value" for each of the
        packages you will find for sale in the market. This value represents how much you value that package if you were
        to close a transaction. In total there are 5 types of tourist packages whose only difference will be the
        destination: Berlín, Madrid, Viena, Paris and Roma. You will only receive five values, one for each package.</p>

    <p>Please note that the values are private, i.e. only you know this numbers. Neither the other buyers nor the
        sellers know this information.</p>

    <p>You will be shown a list of all package offers in the market and their respective prices. To close a transaction,
        you must select one and only one of the packages in the market. Your earnings will be calculated as the
        difference between your valuation and the price at which you purchased the package. If you fail to complete a
        transaction, you won’t make any profit (más la dotación inicial de {{ Constants.endowment }} UME). </p>

    <p>Think of it this way, suppose you have the ability to resell each of the five packages in question, and if you
        manage to get one, you will earn the difference. The value is what you would receive when you resell the
        package. If the value is 70 ECU and you manage to get the package at a price of 50 ECU, then your profit would be
        20 ECU (más la dotación inicial de {{ Constants.endowment }} UME). If you do not succeed in buying the
        package, your profit would be zero, i.e. you would not pay any price and would not receive any income (except
    for the initial endowment of {{ Constants.endowment }} ECU).</p>

    <p>Let's see another example:</p>

    <p>Suppose that the value for the package you decide to buy is 50 ECU and you manage to buy the package at a price
        of 30 ECU. You will then earn 50 ECU - 30 ECU = 20 ECU  (más la dotación inicial de {{ Constants.endowment }} UME).
        If you fail to close a transaction, you will not incur in any cost nor profit, i.e. your profit will be 0 ECU
      (más la dotación inicial de {{ Constants.endowment }} UME).</p>

    <p>It is important to note that two buyers can select the same offer but only one of them will complete the
        transaction. The one who makes the decision to buy the package the fastest will be the one who completes the
        transaction.</p>

    <p>Additionally, notice that the sellers can choose a commercial practice to help make their packages more
        attractive in the market. There are three commercial practices and if a seller uses them, they will be visible
        to the buyer at the time of completing the transaction. However, keep in mind that any of these commercial
        practices can be used truthfully or untruthfully.</p>

    <p>There are three commercial practices available that buyers will be able to use to make their package more
        attractive to the market.</p>
